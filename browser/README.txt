Browser JavaScript apps have been updated to use ES6 modules. Modules should make the code easier to maintain, more future proof, and also compatible with use outside of a browser (e.g. Node.js), however when run in a browser from a local drive, browser security restrictions will keep the codes from running as they have in the past (i.e. simply by clicking on the *.html files). The recommended work-around is to run "python -m http.server" on your local machine and then point your browser to "localhost:8000".
